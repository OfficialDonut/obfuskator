# Obfuskator

Overview:
Obfuskator is not a plugin. After using the program to obfuscate your skript, the skript can be used on your server right away, no extra dependency plugin is required. Obfuskator obfuscates your skript by adding random lines to your code, making it difficult to read.

How to use:
Java 8 is required to run the program, if you only have Java 8 installed on your computer then simply double click the jar to run the program. If you have Java 8 and different versions then run the program from command line with `<path to Java 8 java.exe> -jar <path to Obfuskator.jar>`, for example `C:\Program\Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin\java.exe -jar C:\Users\User\Desktop\Obfuskator.jar`.

Upon running the program the Obfuskator GUI will open:

Enter your skript in the left panel by copy/pasting it, clicking the select file button, or dragging the file into the panel. After entering your skript, click the obfuscate button in the bottom left and the obfuscated skript will be output in the right panel where you can use the bottom buttons to copy it or save it to a file.

Disclaimer:
I tested different skripts as thoroughly as possible but I may have missed a case where the obfuscation breaks the skript. Please report any issues.
